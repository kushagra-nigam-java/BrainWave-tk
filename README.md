# 🧠 BrainWave – Offline-First Learning Platform

BrainWave is an offline-first educational platform designed to support students who face challenges due to poor or inconsistent internet connectivity. The platform allows students to access learning content, practice quizzes, and track their progress without requiring continuous internet access.

The idea behind BrainWave is to make digital education more inclusive, affordable, and accessible, especially for students in rural and semi-urban regions of India.
