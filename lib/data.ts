    subject: "Mathematics",
    grade: "Class 8",
    ncertTopic: "Linear Equations in One Variable",
    chapter: "Chapter 2",
    duration: "15 min",
    syllabus: "Understanding variables, constants, and linear equations; solving simple equations",
    content: `Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Variables**: Letters like x, y, z that represent unknown values
2. **Constants**: Fixed numerical values like 2, 5, -3
3. **Expressions**: Combinations of variables and constants (e.g., 2x + 5)
4. **Equations**: Statements showing two expressions are equal (e.g., 2x + 5 = 15)

**Understanding Variables:**
Variables are like empty boxes that can hold different values. For instance, if we say x = 5, then x is a box containing the number 5. We use variables when we don't know the exact value yet, or when the value can change.

**Solving Linear Equations:**
The goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We do this by performing inverse operations:
- Addition ↔ Subtraction
- Multiplication ↔ Division

**Example Problem 1:**
Solve for x: 2x + 6 = 14
Step 1: Subtract 6 from both sides: 2x + 6 - 6 = 14 - 6 → 2x = 8
Step 2: Divide both sides by 2: 2x ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2 → x = 4
Verification: 2(4) + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 ✓

**Example Problem 2:**
Solve for y: 3y - 5 = 16
Step 1: Add 5 to both sides: 3y - 5 + 5 = 16 + 5 → 3y = 21
Step 2: Divide both sides by 3: 3y ÷ 3 = 21 ÷ 3 → y = 7
Verification: 3(7) - 5 = 21 - 5 = 16 ✓

**Practice Tip:** Always perform the same operation on both sides of an equation to maintain balance. Check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation.

**Real-World Application:**
Algebra helps us solve everyday problems. For example, if you earn ₹50 per hour and want to make ₹500, how many hours do you need to work? We can write: 50x = 500, so x = 10 hours.`,

    ncertTopic: "Water: A Precious Resource",
    chapter: "Chapter 14",
    duration: "12 min",
    syllabus: "Understanding evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection; role of water in human life",
    content: `The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. This never-ending cycle is essential for all life on our planet.

**Main Stages of the Water Cycle:**

1. **Evaporation**: Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into water vapor due to heat from the sun
   - Occurs when heat energy gives water molecules enough energy to escape as gas
   - The sun is the primary source of energy for evaporation
   - Happens faster in warm temperatures and slower in cold weather

2. **Condensation**: Water vapor rises into the atmosphere and cools, forming tiny water droplets that create clouds
   - As warm air rises, it expands and cools
   - When temperature drops below dew point, water vapor condenses into liquid
   - This process forms clouds and dew on grass in the morning

3. **Precipitation**: Water falls back to Earth in various forms
   - Rain: most common form
   - Snow: falls in colder regions
   - Sleet: mixture of rain and ice
   - Hail: frozen raindrops

4. **Collection**: Water collects in different places
   - Oceans and seas (97% of water)
   - Rivers and lakes
   - Underground aquifers and soil
   - Plants and animals

**Transpiration - A Key Component:**
Plants absorb water through roots and release water vapor through leaves. This process is called transpiration. The combined process of evaporation and transpiration is called evapotranspiration.

**Did You Know?**
- The same water has been cycling through Earth for billions of years
- About 97% of Earth's water is in the oceans (salt water)
- Only 3% is freshwater, and most of that (about 68%) is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps
- Less than 1% of freshwater is available for human use
- A single cloud can contain millions of water droplets

**Importance of the Water Cycle:**
- Distributes water across the planet
- Regulates Earth's temperature
- Supports all life forms
- Influences weather patterns
- Provides fresh water for drinking, agriculture, and industry`,

    title: "Geometry Basics",
    subject: "Mathematics",
    grade: "Class 7",
    ncertTopic: "Basic Geometric Shapes",
    chapter: "Chapter 5",
    duration: "13 min",
    syllabus: "Understanding triangles, quadrilaterals, and circles; properties and measurements; perimeter and area calculations",
    content: `Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, positions, and properties of space. The word comes from Greek: "geo" (earth) and "metria" (measurement). Let's explore the fundamental concepts.

**Triangles:**

1. **Triangle**: A polygon with 3 sides and 3 angles
   - Property: Sum of all angles = 180°
   
   Types based on sides:
   - **Equilateral**: All 3 sides equal, all angles 60°
     * Most symmetrical triangle
   - **Isosceles**: Two sides equal, two angles equal
     * The equal angles are opposite the equal sides
   - **Scalene**: All sides different lengths, all angles different
     * No line of symmetry

   Types based on angles:
   - **Acute**: All angles less than 90°
   - **Right**: One angle = 90° (has a hypotenuse)
   - **Obtuse**: One angle greater than 90°

**Quadrilaterals:**

Quadrilaterals are 4-sided polygons with a sum of all angles = 360°

1. **Square**
   - All 4 sides equal
   - All 4 angles = 90°
   - Diagonals are equal and bisect at 90°
   - Perimeter = 4 × side
   - Area = side²

2. **Rectangle**
   - Opposite sides equal
   - All 4 angles = 90°
   - Diagonals are equal
   - Perimeter = 2(length + width)
   - Area = length × width

3. **Parallelogram**
   - Opposite sides parallel and equal
   - Opposite angles equal
   - Diagonals bisect each other
   - Perimeter = 2(length + width)
   - Area = base × height

4. **Rhombus**
   - All 4 sides equal
   - Opposite angles equal
   - Diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other
   - Area = (diagonal₁ × diagonal₂) / 2

5. **Trapezium**
   - One pair of parallel sides (called bases)
   - Area = ½ × (sum of parallel sides) × height

**Circle:**

A circle is a set of all points equidistant from a central point.

Key terms:
- **Radius (r)**: Distance from center to any point on the circle
- **Diameter (d)**: Distance across the circle through the center = 2r
- **Circumference**: The distance around the circle = 2πr = πd
- **Area**: Space enclosed by the circle = πr²

Properties:
- All radii of a circle are equal
- A circle has no corners or edges
- The longest chord of a circle is the diameter

**Important Formulas Summary:**

Perimeter/Circumference:
- Triangle: side₁ + side₂ + side₃
- Rectangle: 2(l + b)
- Square: 4 × side
- Circle: 2πr or πd

Area:
- Rectangle: length × width
- Square: side²
- Triangle: ½ × base × height
- Circle: πr²
- Parallelogram: base × height

**Example Problems:**

1. Find the area of a rectangle with length 8 cm and width 5 cm.
   Area = 8 × 5 = 40 cm²

2. Find the circumference of a circle with radius 7 cm (use π = 22/7).
   Circumference = 2πr = 2 × (22/7) × 7 = 44 cm

3. A triangle has base 10 cm and height 6 cm. Find its area.
   Area = ½ × 10 × 6 = 30 cm²

**Remember:** π (pi) ≈ 3.14159 or 22/7 for calculations.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Architects use geometry to design buildings
- Engineers use it to build bridges and roads
- Artists use geometric principles in drawing and painting
- Cartographers use geometry to create maps`,

    title: "Photosynthesis",
    subject: "Science",
    grade: "Class 7",
    ncertTopic: "Plant Nutrition",
    chapter: "Chapter 1",
    duration: "16 min",
    syllabus: "Understanding photosynthesis process, role of chlorophyll, sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide; importance for life on Earth",
    content: `Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. It's one of the most important biochemical processes on Earth.

**Definition:**
Photosynthesis is a process where plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose (food).

**The Photosynthesis Equation:**
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
(Carbon dioxide + Water + Light energy → Glucose + Oxygen)

**Requirements for Photosynthesis:**

1. **Sunlight**: Energy source for the entire process
   - Only the wavelengths that chlorophyll can absorb are useful
   - More sunlight = faster photosynthesis

2. **Water (H₂O)**: Absorbed by roots and transported to leaves
   - Provides hydrogen for glucose formation
   - Needed in both light and dark reactions

3. **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: Obtained from the air through stomata (pores in leaves)
   - Provides carbon for glucose formation
   - Stored in the form of glucose for future use

4. **Chlorophyll**: Green pigment in chloroplasts
   - Absorbs light energy
   - Found primarily in leaves

**Two Main Stages:**

1. **Light Reactions** (occurring in thylakoid membranes)
   - Requires light (cannot occur in darkness)
   - Water is split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct
   - Energy (ATP) and reducing power (NADPH) are produced
   - Takes place in the day

2. **Dark Reactions** (Calvin Cycle - occurring in stroma)
   - Can occur with or without light
   - Uses ATP and NADPH from light reactions
   - Converts CO₂ into glucose
   - Doesn't directly require light but depends on products from light reactions

**Why is Photosynthesis Important?**

- **Produces Food**: Creates organic compounds that form the base of food chains
- **Produces Oxygen**: The oxygen we breathe is a byproduct of photosynthesis
- **Removes CO₂**: Helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
- **Energy Source**: Stores solar energy in chemical bonds for all living organisms
- **Supports Life**: Without photosynthesis, life as we know it couldn't exist

**Factors Affecting Photosynthesis:**
- Light intensity: More light increases photosynthesis up to a saturation point
- Temperature: Optimal range is 25-35°C
- CO₂ concentration: Increased CO₂ increases photosynthesis
- Water availability: Essential for the process
- Chlorophyll content: More chlorophyll = more photosynthesis

**Interesting Facts:**
- Plants conduct photosynthesis 24/7 during daylight
- A single plant can produce enough oxygen for two people
- Leaves change color in autumn because chlorophyll breaks down`,

    duration: "14 min",
    syllabus: "Understanding factors, multiples, prime numbers, composite numbers, HCF, and LCM",
    content: `Factors and multiples are fundamental concepts in number theory. Understanding them helps in solving complex mathematical problems.

**Factors:**

A factor of a number is a number that divides it completely with no remainder.

Example: Factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- 1 × 12 = 12
- 2 × 6 = 12
- 3 × 4 = 12

**Properties of Factors:**
- 1 is a factor of every number
- Every number is a factor of itself
- Number of factors is always finite

**Multiples:**

A multiple of a number is obtained by multiplying that number by any natural number.

Example: Multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ...

**Properties of Multiples:**
- Every number is a multiple of itself
- Multiples are infinite
- The smallest multiple is the number itself
- Multiples can be found using multiplication

**Prime Numbers:**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with exactly two factors: 1 and itself.

Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47...

**Special Notes:**
- 2 is the only even prime number
- 1 is neither prime nor composite

**Composite Numbers:**

A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that has more than two factors.

Composite numbers: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20...

Example: 12 has factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

**HCF (Highest Common Factor) / GCD:**

The HCF is the greatest number that divides two or more numbers without remainder.

Method 1: Listing factors
Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
Common factors: 1, 2, 3, 6
HCF(18, 24) = 6

Method 2: Prime factorization
18 = 2 × 3²
24 = 2³ × 3
HCF = 2 × 3 = 6

**LCM (Least Common Multiple):**

The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more given numbers.

Method 1: Listing multiples
Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...
Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...
Common multiples: 12, 24, 36, ...
LCM(4, 6) = 12

Method 2: Prime factorization
4 = 2²
6 = 2 × 3
LCM = 2² × 3 = 12

**Relationship between HCF and LCM:**
For any two numbers a and b:
HCF(a, b) × LCM(a, b) = a × b

**Real-World Applications:**
- Finding HCF: Dividing objects into equal groups
- Finding LCM: Determining when events will occur together again
- Example: If buses leave every 4 hours and trains every 6 hours, when will they leave together?
  LCM(4, 6) = 12 hours`,

   - Tube connecting mouth to stomach
   - Length: About 25 cm
   - Moves food through peristalsis (muscular contractions)
   - No digestion occurs here

3. **Stomach**
   - Muscular bag-like organ
   - Produces gastric juice containing:
     * Pepsin: Enzyme that breaks down proteins
     * HCl (Hydrochloric acid): Creates acidic environment
     * Mucus: Protects stomach lining
   - Churns food into a paste called chyme
   - Digestion time: 3-4 hours

4. **Small Intestine**
   - Most important site of digestion and absorption
   - Three parts: Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileum
   - Length: 6-7 meters
   - Receives:
     * Bile from liver: Breaks down fats
     * Pancreatic juice: Contains enzymes for carbs, proteins, fats
     * Intestinal juice: Contains various enzymes
   - Has tiny finger-like projections called villi for absorption

5. **Large Intestine**
   - Absorbs water and minerals
   - Forms feces
   - Length: 1.5 meters
   - Contains beneficial bacteria

6. **Rectum and Anus**
   - Stores and expels feces
   - Last part of digestive system

**Accessory Organs:**

1. **Liver**
   - Produces bile for fat digestion
   - Stores nutrients
   - Detoxifies harmful substances
   - Regulates blood sugar

2. **Pancreas**
   - Produces pancreatic juice with digestive enzymes
   - Produces insulin for blood sugar regulation
   - Produces glucagon

3. **Gallbladder**
   - Stores bile
   - Releases bile when needed for fat digestion

**Stages of Digestion:**

1. **Mechanical Digestion**
   - Physical breakdown of food
   - Occurs in mouth and stomach through chewing and churning
   - Increases surface area for chemical digestion

2. **Chemical Digestion**
   - Breakdown of food using enzymes and other chemicals
   - Starts in mouth with salivary amylase
   - Continues in stomach with pepsin
   - Completes in small intestine

**Important Enzymes:**

- **Amylase**: Breaks down carbohydrates (starch) → sugars
- **Protease**: Breaks down proteins → amino acids
- **Lipase**: Breaks down fats → fatty acids and glycerol

**Journey of Food Through Digestive System:**

1. Food enters mouth → chewed and mixed with saliva (5-30 seconds)
2. Swallowed and travels through esophagus → stomach (10 seconds)
3. Mixed with stomach acid and enzymes for 3-4 hours
4. Enters small intestine → further broken down and absorbed (3-5 hours)
5. Remaining material → large intestine (24-48 hours)
6. Feces → expelled through anus

**Tips for Healthy Digestion:**
- Chew food properly (at least 30 times)
- Eat slowly
- Drink plenty of water
- Include fiber-rich foods (vegetables, fruits, whole grains)
- Don't eat before sleeping
- Maintain regular meal times
- Exercise regularly`,
